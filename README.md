# Zomato_data_analysis

# Problem Statement:
  The goal of this project is to analyze the Zomato restaurant data to understand what factors contribute to higher restaurant ratings. Specifically, we aim to 
  identify how restaurant reviews, costs, and votes impact overall user satisfaction and ratings. This analysis will provide valuable insights that can guide 
  restaurant owners, consumers, and platforms like Zomato to make informed decisions.

# Objectives:
1. Data Collection and Details:
   Like - Cuisine types, Average cost for two people, Rating, etc.
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
   Handling Missing Data: Check for missing values in important columns like ratings, cost. Decide whether to fill, drop, or impute missing data.
   Data Types: Make sure all columns are in the correct data type (e.g., ratings as float, cost as integer).
   Remove Duplicates: Ensure no duplicate entries are present in your dataset.
3. Analysis:
   Rating Distribution by mode: Which mode has the highest average rating online or offline?
   Restaurant Type: How do casual dining, fine dining, etc., compare in terms of ratings and votes?

# Outcome:
  By conducting this analysis, we aim to provide actionable insights that can benefit:
  Restaurant Owners: To understand what factors drive better customer ratings and how they can improve their offerings.
  Zomato/Other Platforms: To identify the most successful markets, popular cuisines, and areas for potential business growth.
  Consumers: To help users make informed decisions based on restaurant ratings, cost, and votes when exploring options on the platform.
